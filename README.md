# trying to write a source-plugin for Gatsby and Sanity

Current state:
Filling Gatsby with nodes and downloads/creates image-nodes based on the "_ref" from image types.
Trying to figure out how to handle the "block"-type cases and handling of marks etc.

Any suggestions or feedback (about anything really) are welcome.
